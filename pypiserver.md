PIP Local server on ASBUILD01
===============


The local pypiserver is installed on the asbuild01 (on port 8081). To add the repository on the pip.ini file (On Windows, linux pip.conf)
use these lines 

````
[global]
extra-index-url = http://asbuild01:8081/
trusted-host = asbuild01
[install]
trusted-host = asbuild01
````
after these modification you should be able to directly use the `pip insall` to install the local packages.
or if you did not modified the pip.ini then just pass it on the command 
````
pip install --extra-index-url http://asbuild01:8081 --trusted-host asbuild01 ic3019
````

to upload the package after build, you could use the twine package. command will be :
````
twine upload --repository-url http://asbuild01:8081 dist\astools-0.0.*.tar*
````    


to generate the passwd file for authentication on the server side, we could use the openssl 

```
❯ openssl passwd -apr1 password
$apr1$BT6io9g2$w6UDMeKMwL25FlIZ.qUvt0
``` 

```
./pypi-server -p 8080 -P htpasswd.txt ~/packages
```
